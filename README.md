# Conversion-American-Sign-Language-to-Text

**Introduction:**

 American sign language is a predominant sign language Since the only disability D&M people have been communication related and they cannot use spoken languages hence the only way for them to communicate is through sign language. Communication is the process of exchange of thoughts and messages in various ways such as speech, signals, behavior and visuals. Deaf and dumb(D&M) people make use of their hands to express different gestures to express their ideas with other people. Gestures are the nonverbally exchanged messages and these gestures are understood with vision. This nonverbal communication of deaf and dumb people is called sign language. 

In our project we basically focus on producing a model which can recognise Fingerspelling based hand gestures in order to form a complete word by combining each gesture. The gestures we aim to train are as given in the image below.
